# PureWeb Rules

This repo hosts the **remote rule set** for the [PureWeb](https://github.com/) browser extension.  
Rules here tell PureWeb how to detect and hide AI overviews, answer panels, and other ‚Äúnoise‚Äù in search results.

	‚Ä¢	PRs welcome if you find a new AI box selector or keyword that slips through.
	‚Ä¢	Keep keywords broad but not too generic (avoid words that appear in normal search results).
	‚Ä¢	Use selectors when you can reliably target a container element.

‚∏ª
